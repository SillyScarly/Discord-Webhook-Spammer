Discord Webhook Spammer 
##########################
Requirements To use discord Webhook spammer :

A role in a discord server that has accesss to create and delete Webhooks for specific channels. 
If there is an existing Webhook for a specified channel and you know the Webhook url, you can use that as well.

########################
How to setup the script : 

It's a very simple thing to do. 
You will need your webhook url for this. 
Once you have your webhook url, replace the String "Webhook url" with your webhook url and make sure you have the "" around the webhook url otherwise python won't register it as a string. 
For the String "Message" you can put any word 
You want in the "Message" string. This will be your Message that your Webhook will send to the channel. 
 
Don't get ahead of yourself. You still have two things to do And one is optional. First thing is the string "Raid bot" can be changed to any name you desire. This will act as your webhook username. Webhooks are like Discord Scripts that act as bots almost.
Default username is configured to "Raid bot". Feel free to change it if you want.
############################
The Final step of using the webhook spammer : 

The last thing you have to do is run the script in any software that runs python. For example, I use Pycharm Community edition to run the python script, but you can use any other application you feel comfortable with.
Once you finished all the steps and configured The webhook correctly you will have a running webhook spammer! 
As always I hope you have a great day and Have fun!
